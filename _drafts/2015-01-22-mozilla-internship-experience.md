I recently had someone message me privately on Quora and ask about my
internship experience at Mozilla. I figured this might help others as
well, so here's the conversation -

> Hi! I read from the 2014 Summer interns list that you were an intern

Congratulations on the offer! My room mate interned with the networking team
at Mozilla. He enjoyed it a lot and he is still working on Necko IIRC.

Here are *my* opinions -

### Positives - 

* Insanely smart people - I pretty much learned something new everyday
  during code reviews or even at [lunch](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps/ShowAndTells/Recordings).

* Lots of cool stuff - I worked on porting a game library (SDL2)
  written in C to JS using a cross compiler called Emscripten. I'd
  never worked on any graphics stuff or a compiler before, so I learnt
  a ton.

* Work on whatever you want - I was initially assigned a project which
  I didn't really fancy and told my mentor about it. I was allowed to
  switch teams and I was given a list of projects ideas to choose from.

* Awesome compensation - Competitive pay + free laptop + housing + relocation stipend

* Known for engineering quality - You'll end up getting interviews
  from pretty much everywhere after this.

* Perks - Awesome library + multiple fully stocked kitchens + game room + Caltrain pass (if you know how to get it)

* Other interns are awesome - Pretty much had a bbq party every friday
  at the housing complex, and there was some party happening at the
  office every week.

* Bay Area is awesome - There's lots of interesting intern events
  happening all over the summer. Make sure to watch out for
  that -- Pinterest and Facebook had pretty awesome intern open houses
  last summer.

* Open Source - Pretty much every piece of code you write is open
  source. I'm a big FOSS fan boy so this was pretty cool.

### Negatives - 

* Most employees are remote - It might get frustrating if you're not
  used to asynchronous feedback cycle. Mozilla tries to set you up
  with a on-site mentor but sometimes that's not possible. If you're
  not a fan of this, let your recruiter or manager know. Iinitially had a
  remote mentor, but was re-assigned an on-site mentor after I told my
  manager about it. I know a bunch of other interns who didn't do this
  and went on to have a bad experience.

* Full time opportunities are extremely limited - If you're a Senior
  looking to convert your internship to a full time position then I'd
  recommend some other place.

> What do you think about the controversies that happened with Mozilla
> last year? Did it affect interns and employee's morale?

I don't really have any opinions on the controversy. I don't
think the controversy affected the morale, but I don't think people
were happy about -

* Pushing Firefox OS and not focusing on Firefox Desktop
* Firefox market share dropping

I don't think any of this affected my internship. I may have thought
more about all this if I was joining full time.
